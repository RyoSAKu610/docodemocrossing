# web3-business-card
we have to know each other when we begin new era
1-1 Problem	Awkward first-time conversations / Difficulty seeing the true nature of connections.	Adding statistical data (e.g., follow-up rates after exchanging business cards at events) would make it more persuasive.
4 Solution	Analyze dApp usage trends with AI and express personality as an animal (avatar/persona).	Good to explain this as a "social layer" that data-fies one's character/personality.
9 Unfair Advantage	Proof of Humanity + NFT + AI Personality Analysis.	Difficult to replicate on other chains (Emphasize Solana's high speed + AI API integration).
2-2 Early Adopters	Hackathon participants / Web3 event attendees.	Give real-world event examples (e.g., Breakpoint, IVS Crypto).
5 Channels	Solana community, Superteam, Solana Mobile.	When submitting to Colosseum, clearly state these potential partners.
